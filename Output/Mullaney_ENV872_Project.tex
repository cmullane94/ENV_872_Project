\section{Rationale and Research
Questions}\label{rationale-and-research-questions}}

As the demand for seafood products has increased over the last six
decades, unsustainable fishing, which can result from both illegal
fishing practices as well as poor fisheries management, has been
increasingly recognized as a pressing problem (FAO 2018). Coral reef
fisheries are especially subject to unsustainability because of
increasing coastal populations and the expansion of markets for live
coral reef fishes (Pauly et al.~2002; Bellwood et al.~2004). Reef fish
overexploitation affects the reef community as a whole -- for example,
the targeting of large, predatory reef fish at high trophic levels can
alter and destablize the structure of reef communities (Pauly et
al.~2002; Bellwood et al.~2004; Newton et al.~2007). The negative
effects of overfishing on reef ecosystems -- along with other coral
stressors such as climate change, ocean acidification, and nutrient
pollution -- continue to impact fish communities through the
deterioration of coral, the domination of macroalgae, and decreases in
reef structural complexity (Bellwood et al.~2004; Darling et al.~2017).

The use of no-take marine reserves to conserve reef communities and
manage fishing impacts has increased over the last two decades and have
shown to be effective tools that are capable of increasing fish density,
fish species richness, and coral abundance and health (Williamson et
al.~2004; Lester et al.~2009; Castro-Sanguino et al.~2017). Australia's
Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world, and,
like other reefs worldwide, is exhibiting signs of system-wide
degradation (Bellwood et al.~2004; Fraser et al.~2017). Zoning was first
introduced into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) between
1981-1988, and a new zoning management plan was implemented in 2004
(Williamson et al.~2004; Castro-Sanguino et al.~2017).

To examine the effects of GBRMP zoning practices on fish density, fish
species richness, and coral abundance, as well as to determine what
variables impact fish density and coral abundance, a dataset with
varibles concerning zones, fish and coral abundance, and the abundance
of specific fish functional groups was selected -- the chosen dataset is
one of the few projects established with the goal of specifically
assessing the ecological effects of multiple-use zoning on the inshore
coral reefs of the GBRMP (Lawrey 2014). Choice of dataset was also
influenced by timespan -- this project is the only long-term monitoring
project with a dataset that was established prior to the implementation
of the new zoning management plan in 2004 (Lawrey 2014).

This project sought to answer the following questions about the inshore
coral reefs of the GBRMP:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What variables affect the percentage cover of live hard coral?
\item
  What variables affect fish density?
\item
  Do no-take zones established in 1987, no-take zones established in
  2004, and fished zones have different mean amounts of live hard coral
  cover, fish density, and fish species richness?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Database Information}\label{database-information}}

Data were originally collected by by the ARC Centre of Excellence for
Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. They were accessed via the
Australian government's database for open government data, data.gov.au:
\url{https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/031f0668-b874-48fc-a058-f146c2f6fc69}

Data files were hosted in the eAtlas data repository:

\subsection{Data Wrangling}\label{data-wrangling}}

From the downloaded dataset, the
\texttt{E-Atlas\ Data\_NERP\ 8.2\_Dec\ 2014\_fish\_benthos.xlsx} file
contained two sheets; the first gave data averaged by site and was saved
in the repository as
\texttt{data.gov.au\_fish\_benthos\_GBR\_sites\_raw.csv} for wrangling
and analysis. Three processed files were created from this dataset. To
create the first processed file,
\texttt{data.gov.au\_fish\_benthos\_GBR\_sites\_1999\_processed.csv},
the variables listed in the table below were first selected. Then, rows
with known outliers -- mean live total coral percent cover and mean live
hard coral percent cover values that were greater than 100 -- were
filtered out of the dataset. The second processed file,
\texttt{data.gov.au\_fish\_benthos\_GBR\_sites\_2004\_processed.csv},
was created using the same steps plus an additional one: all rows with
values of \texttt{na} were omitted from the data. This gave a processed
dataset containing data starting in 2004 rather than 1999. The final
processed file, \texttt{data.gov.au\_fish\_lme\_2004\_processed.csv},
was created during data analysis; a column containing predicted values
based on a mixed-effects linear model was added to
\texttt{data.gov.au\_fish\_benthos\_GBR\_sites\_2004\_processed.csv} to
allow the creating of a graph containing trend lines based on the model.

\hypertarget{metadata}{%
\subsection{Metadata}\label{metadata}}

These data, which were collected between 1999 and 2014 on the inshore
coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, contain the average
percent cover of major benthic categories as well as the average density
of fish functional groups. Underwater visual census (UVC) methodology
was used to survey these fish and benthic communities. Within each site,
UVC surveys were conducted using 5 replicate transects (each 50m x 6m)
deployed on the reef slope between approximately 4 and 12 meters. Due to
funding limitations and unpredictable weather events, there were some
years where data was not collected. Data concerning fish species (Total
Fish Densit\_mean, Fish Species richness\_mean, Grazers\_mean,
Corallivores\_mean) began being collected in 2004.

\section{Exploratory Analysis}\label{exploratory-analysis}}

Although data began being collected in 1999, some data related to fish
species density and richness, as well as other fish related data, did
not begin being monitored until 2004. Although some viable data will
have to be removed in analyses where fish data are involved, there
appears to be similar proportions of zone types when looking at data
from 1999-2014 and 2004-2014 (Figure 1).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Mullaney_ENV872_Project_files/figure-latex/Zone Exploratory Plot-1}

\caption{The number of fished zones, no-take zones established in 1987, and no-take zones established in 2004 when data from 1999-2014 are included (bottom) and data from only 2004-2014 are included (top).}\label{fig:Zone Exploratory Plot}
\end{figure}

In looking at the frequency of macroalgae and coral percent cover from
1999-2014, macroalgae frequently has 0\% cover while live coral most
frequently has coverage percentages around 40 (Figure 2); these
frequencies indicate that many of the sites sampled remain dominated by
coral rather than macroalgae. In examining the relationship between
living coral and macroalge further, it appears that mean fleshy
macroalge percent cover is negatively correlated with mean living hard
coral percent cover (Figure 3).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Mullaney_ENV872_Project_files/figure-latex/Coral Algae Exploratory Plot-1}

}

\caption{Mean fleshy macroalgae percent cover plotted against mean live hard coral percent cover (1999-2014).}\label{fig:Coral Algae Scatter}
\end{figure}

When examining mean fish density and mean percent live hard coral across
2004-2014, it appears as though fish density has the smallest range in
2004 and 2012-2014 (Figure 4). From 2011-2014, coral coverage has been
low compared to 2009, although it has consistently reached values of
above 50\% (Figure 4). Coral cover appears as though it could be
slightly positively correlated with fish density (Figure 5).

GBRMP?}\label{question-1-what-variables-affect-the-percentage-cover-of-live-hard-coral-on-the-inshore-coral-reefs-of-the-gbrmp}}

To determine factors influencing live hard coral cover within the GBRMP,
a mixed-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used. To
account for the random effects of study site and allow extrapolation of
results to potential study sites not included in the data, site was
included as a random effect. The best-fitting model, which was found
using stepwise Akaike information criterion (AIC) analysis, contained
the explanatory variables of year, the mean number of grazer fish
species, the mean number of corallivore fish species, and the mean
percentage cover of fleshy macroalgae. Year, the mean number of grazer
fish species, the mean percentage cover of fleshy macroalgae
significantly decrease the mean percentage of live hard coral cover,
while the mean number of corallivore fish species significantly increase
the mean percentage of live hard coral cover (pseudo
R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.8078; Figures 6 \& 7). When all other variables
are held constant, each additional fish included in the mean number of
grazers will decrease mean live hard coral percent cover by 0.0227\% (df
= 358, t = -2.805, p \textless{} 0.05). Similarly, a one unit increase
in the mean macroalgae percent cover will decrease mean live hard coral
percent cover by 0.354\% (df = 358, t = 7.641, p \textless{} 0.0001),
while a one unit increase in the mean number of corallivores will
increase mean live hard coral percent cover by 0.265\% (df = 358, t =
7.812, p \textless{} 0.0001). A post hoc Tukey test was used to evaluate
pairwise relationships of different years and extract groupings based on
these pairwise relationships (Figures 6 \& 7).

To determine factors influencing mean total fish density within the
GBRMP, a mixed-effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used.
To again account for the random effects of study site and allow
extrapolation of results to potential study sites not included in the
data, site was included as a random effect. The best-fitting model,
which was found using stepwise AIC analysis, contained the explanatory
variables of year and mean percentage of live hard coral cover. The mean
percentage of live hard coral cover was found to increase the natural
log of mean total fish density (pseudo R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.8087;
Figure 8). When all other variables are held constant, each additional
1\% of live hard coral cover will increase the mean total fish density
by 1.536\% (df = 360, t = 7.429, p \textless{} 0.0001). A post hoc Tukey
test was used to evaluate pairwise relationships of different years and
extract groupings based on these pairwise relationships (Figure 8).

To determine if mean fish density, mean fish species richness, and mean
percent coral cover were significantly different among the three GBRMP
zones in the data (no-take since 1987, no-take since 2004, and fished),
three analysis of variance (ANCOVA) models were used. Zone was not found
to significantly affect mean percent live coral cover
(F\textsubscript{2,703} = 0.1649, p \textgreater{} 0.1) or mean fish
species richness (F\textsubscript{2,467} = 2.396, p \textgreater{}
0.05). However, zone did significantly affect mean fish species density
(F\textsubscript{2,467} = 6.137, p \textless{} 0.01) with the no-take
zones from 2004 increasing mean fish density by 39.780\% (t = 3.171, p
\textless{} 0.01). A post hoc Tukey test was used to evaluate pairwise
relationships of different zones and extract groupings based on these
pairwise relationships (Figure 9).
