# ENV_872_Project

## Summary

This repository was prepared to hold data, code, and other output for Duke University's Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872) Spring 2020 final project. The analysis for this project will focus on the fish species and benthos of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. 

## Investigators

This repository was created and assembled by Claire Mullaney, a Duke University Master of Environmental Management student (claire.mullaney@duke.edu). 

## Keywords

Great Barrier Reef, coral reefs, fish, benthos, complexity, coral cover, marine science

## Database Information
Data were originally collected by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University and were hosted at the eAtlas data repository (http://eatlas.org.au/pydio/data/public/833ece.php). They were accessed via the Australian Government's database at: https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/031f0668-b874-48fc-a058-f146c2f6fc69

More information on this database can be found here: https://search.data.gov.au/page/about

More information on eAtlas can be found here: https://eatlas.org.au/content/about-e-atlas

These csv files were saved as `eAtlas_fish_benthos_GBR_sites_raw.csv` and `eAtlas_fish_benthos_GBR_zones_raw.csv`.

Data were accessed 2020-04-10.

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

Folders contained in the repository include:

**Code**: R scripts created to analyze data (.r)
**Data/Raw**: Data files in their orginal formatting (.csv) 
**Data/Processed**: Revised data files created from raw data files during analysis (.csv)
**Output**: R Markdown files (.rmd) and PDFs (.pdf) used to discuss and visualize data and analyses

Files in the data folder are named according to the following convention: `database_description_details_stage.format`.

**database** is the database from which the data were obtained

**description** is a description of data 

**details** are additional details necessary to understand the content of the dataset

**stage** indicates the point where the file is located in the data science pipeline (in these files, stage will either be "raw" or "processed")

**format** is the file's format (e.g., .csv)

## Metadata

Both `eAtlas_fish_benthos_GBR_sites_raw.csv` and `eAtlas_fish_benthos_GBR_zones_raw.csv` contain the following columns: 

Dataset Column | Description | Class
---------------| ----------- | -----
**Year** | Year of data collection | Integer
**Region** | The island group (Palm, Magnetic, Whitsunday or Keppel) of the coral reef that was surveyed | Factor
**Zone** | Indicates if data were collected in a no-take zone established in 1987 (NTR 1987), a no-take zone established in 2004 (NTR 2004), or a zone where fishing is allowed (Fished) | Factor
**Total Fish Densit_mean** | Mean number of fish observed per 1000 m^2^ at the specified site | Numeric
**Total Fish Densit_SE** | The standard error of the mean number of fish observed per 1000 m^2^ at the specified site | Numeric
**Fish Species richness_mean** | The mean number of fish species observed at the specified site | Numeric
**Fish Species richness_SE** | The standard error of the mean number of fish species observed at the specified site | Numeric
**Fishery Target Spp_mean** |  Mean number of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Fishery Target Spp_SE** | Standard error of the mean number of fish species designated as 'Primary target’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Grazers_mean** | Mean number of fish species listed as ‘grazers’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Grazers_SE** | Standard error of the mean number of fish species listed as ‘grazers’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Corallivores_mean** | Mean number of fish species listed as ‘corallivores’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Coraliivores_SE** | Numeric
**Planktivores_mean** | Mean number of fish species listed as ‘planktivores’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Planktivores_SE** | Standard error of the mean number of fish species listed as ‘planktivores’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file  | Numeric
**Territorial Pomacentrids_mean** | Mean number of fish species listed as ‘territorial pomacentrids’ in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file | Numeric
**Territorial Pomacentrids_SE** | Numeric
**Plectropomus spp_mean** | Mean number of observed fish species in the genus ***Plectropomus*** (i.e., coral groupers; all species of coral groupers observed are listed in the `eAtlas_fish_groups_status.csv` metadata file) | Numeric
**Plectropomus spp_SE** | Standard error of the mean number of observed fish species in the genus ***Plectropomus*** | Numeric
**SCI_mean** | Mean structural complexity index at each site. Individual SCI values range from 1 to 25, with values closer to 1 indicating less structural complexity and values closer to 25 indicating more structural complexity. Each SCI estimate was calculated by multiplying visual estimates of reef slope angle (1-5) by reef slope rugosity (1-5). These values were estimated for each 10m section of each 50m transect for a total of 5 estimates per transect. With 5 transects deployed per site, a total of 25 SCI values were estimated per site. These 25 values were averaged to obtain the mean SCI. | Numeric
**SCI_SE** | Standard error of the mean SCI at each site | Numeric
**LCC_mean** | Mean live hard and soft coral % cover | Numeric
**LCC_SE** | Srandard error of the mean live hard and soft coral % cover | Numeric
**LHC_mean** | Mean live hard coral % cover | Numeric
**LHC_SE** | Standard error of the mean live hard coral % cover | Numeric
**MAC_mean** | Mean macroalgae % cover (includes only fleshy algae, not turf algae) | Numeric
**MAC_SE** | Standard error of the mean macroalgae % cover | Numeric

`eAtlas_fish_benthos_GBR_sites_raw.csv` contains the following additional column:

Dataset Column | Description | Class
---------------| ----------- | -----
**Site** | The ID of the site (where five transect surveys were conducted) within the specified zone, region, and year | Factor
